The aim of this project is to make a sound-controlled RGB LED strip for cheap 
awesome home-illumination. It's controlled through an IR remote and has some music-reactive effects.

Hardware used: 
	* Arduino UNO
	* RGB LED strip
	* IR remote + IR sensor
	* Electret microphone
	* Home-made LED driver circuit

IR remote controls:
	* On/Off
	* 16 pre-programmed colours
	* Brigthness +/-
	* 4 "effect buttons":
		* Turn On lights with a clap or any sound
		* Blink current colour - sound activated
		* Blink random colours - sound activated
		* Change between random colours - sound activated

There's a Fritzing diagram that explains pretty much all connection-side, though you should take into account your hardware might be wired differently. I used 3 TIP120 in order to provide electricity to my 5m LEDstrip as long as I keep my arduino plugged to the socket.

I should note that my cheap electret's microphone analog output was pretty useless so I had to make all the sound-reactive functions based on the digital on/off output it also has. No fancy fourier transforms over analog sound waves were used, sorry. It still does the trick visually so who cares :P 

There is an included library for controlling RGB LEDs. It should be able to handle anything from a led to 1000 meters of them, as long as you power them all. It does anything from coloring to brightness and some effects like strobe or fade are included too.
